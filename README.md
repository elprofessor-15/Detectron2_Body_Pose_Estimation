Body Pose Estimation with Detectron2

This repository demonstrates the use of Detectron2 for implementing Body Pose Estimation. Pose estimation refers to detecting human keypoints (joints such as shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.) in an image, providing precise coordinates of each keypoint for each individual in the frame.

Overview

The notebook utilizes Detectron2’s Keypoint R-CNN model, a powerful framework for detecting human body keypoints in images and videos. This model is widely used in human pose estimation tasks, enabling us to track the movement and positioning of human joints in real-time.

Key objectives of this project:

	•	Use a pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model from the Detectron2 library.
	•	Run inference on images and videos to estimate human body poses.
	•	Visualize the body pose predictions by plotting detected keypoints.
	•	Optionally, fine-tune the model on a custom dataset for specific applications.

What’s Included

The repository consists of the following components:

	1.	Detectron2 Body Pose Estimation Notebook:
	•	Step-by-step implementation of pose estimation using Detectron2.
	•	Code to load the pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model, process images/videos, and generate body pose predictions.
	2.	Sample Images:
	•	A few example images with multiple humans where the model has been applied to detect and visualize human poses.
	3.	Visualization:
	•	Visualization of the detected keypoints and skeletons on human bodies in the images/videos.

Features

	•	Human Pose Estimation: Detect and localize key human body joints (e.g., eyes, shoulders, hips, knees, etc.) in an image.
	•	Keypoint Detection: Identify 17 keypoints per person in the image, including hands, feet, and head positions.
	•	Pre-trained Models: Leverage pre-trained models trained on the COCO dataset, which has labeled keypoints for thousands of images.
	•	Real-Time Inference: Detect human poses in images or video streams efficiently with real-time performance using Detectron2’s optimized framework.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Detectron2
	•	OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization

Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:
!git clone https://github.com/elprofessor-15/Detectron2_Body_Pose_Estimation.git
cd detectron2-body-pose-estimation

2.	Install Dependencies:

To install the required libraries, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can manually install Detectron2:
!pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu113/torch1.10/index.html
3.	Download Pre-Trained Weights:
The notebook uses pre-trained weights for Keypoint R-CNN from the Detectron2 Model Zoo. These will be automatically downloaded when running the notebook.

Usage:
1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:
 jupyter notebook detectron2_body_pose_estimation_demo.ipynb

 2.	Run Pose Estimation on Sample Images:
The notebook guides you through loading images and applying the pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model to detect and visualize keypoints for pose estimation.
	3.	Visualizing Pose Estimation:
After running the model, keypoints and skeletons will be drawn on the input images to show the estimated body poses of individuals.

Fine-Tuning (Optional)

This notebook demonstrates inference using a pre-trained model, but Detectron2 allows you to fine-tune the pose estimation model on your custom datasets. By fine-tuning the model, you can adapt it to specific use cases such as sports analysis, human-computer interaction, or rehabilitation.

How to Fine-Tune:

	1.	Prepare a dataset in COCO format with annotated keypoints.
	2.	Modify the config file for fine-tuning.
	3.	Use Detectron2’s training utilities to fine-tune the Keypoint R-CNN model on your custom dataset.

Performance Evaluation (Optional)

Detectron2 provides tools to evaluate model performance on pose estimation tasks, including metrics like:

	•	Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS), which measures keypoint localization accuracy.
	•	Precision/Recall for keypoint detection.

 Conclusion

This repository showcases the implementation of Body Pose Estimation using Detectron2’s Keypoint R-CNN model. With Detectron2’s efficient architecture, pose estimation can be applied to a wide range of applications, from human behavior analysis to motion tracking and more.
